# Hi, I'm Erin!
### I am a Forensic Chemist specializing in species identification of timber. 
#### I use an instrument called a Direct Analysis in Real Time Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (or simply, "DART"), to collect spectra from thousands of different tree species. The spectra acts as a kind of chemical "fingerprint" for each species and can be used to identify unknown wood products. Here is a picture of me running samples on the DART:

#### Once I have spectra, I generate models using [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.sartorius.com/en/knowledge/science-snippets/what-is-principal-component-analysis-pca-and-how-it-is-used-507186), [Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components](https://bmcgenomdata.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-11-94), as well as machine learning algorithms such as [Suppport Vector Machine](https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-934a444fca47). These models help me to verify legal wood products as well as to identify protected species.

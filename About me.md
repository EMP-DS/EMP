# Hi, I'm Erin!
### I am a Forensic Chemist specializing in species identification of timber. 
#### I use an instrument called a Direct Analysis in Real Time Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (or simply, "DART"), to collect spectra from thousands of different tree species. The spectra acts as a kind of chemical "fingerprint" for each species and can be used to identify unknown wood products. Here is a picture of me running samples on the DART:

#### Once I have spectra, I generate models using [PCA]([https://www.sartorius.com/en/knowledge/science-snippets/what-is-principal-component-analysis-pca-and-how-it-is-used-507186]), DAPC,
